		<textarea class="displayed" id="myarea">You were on vacation in the South Pacific when your small cruise ship developed a mechanical failure and sunk! Only a few people survived along with your self. After floating in a life raft for two days you washed ashore on a deserted island. All you have in the life raft is a compass. The time has come to find food and water. 	Decide whether you want to travel North, South East or West. Choose wisely because the island is uncharted. If you get hurt no one coming to your rescue! 		--May the odds be ever in your favor! 		</textarea>
